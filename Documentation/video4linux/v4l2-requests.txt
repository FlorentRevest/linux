Introduction
============

It is often useful to apply certain settings when a buffer is about to be
filled by the DMA capture of a video capture device, ensuring that those
settings are applied in time for them to be used with that buffer.

One of the prime use-cases of this is Android's CameraHAL v3 which requires
per-frame configuration support.

But other use-cases are possible as well: changing codec settings (bit rate,
etc.) starting with a specific buffer, preparing a configuration to be applied
at a certain time, etc.

The request API is the way V4L2 solved this problem.


Basic Mechanism
===============

Requests are implemented by building on top of the control framework, adding
new 'request' fields to various v4l2 structs and by adding a new ioctl:
VIDIOC_REQUEST_CMD.

The core are the additions to the control framework: normally when a control
is set the control's value is applied immediately in the hardware. But the
request API allows you to specify the control value for a specific request
ID (from 1-0xffff). The control value is validated and stored for that request,
but it won't be applied until later.

Each control can support up to N requests where N is expected to be a multiple
of VIDEO_MAX_FRAME. If N is 0, then it cannot be used with requests. Many
controls (e.g. V4L2_CID_POWER_LINE_FREQUENCY) just make no sense in a request
context.

How many requests each control supports can be queried with VIDIOC_QUERY_EXT_CTRL
and by checking the max_reqs field.

Getting/setting/trying controls for a request can be done in two ways: one
is to use the VIDIOC_REQUEST_CMD ioctl (more about that later), the other is
to use VIDIOC_G/S/TRY_EXT/CTRLS and fill in a non-zero request ID. If the
request ID is 0, then the normal behavior applies: so controls are set immediately.

Request IDs are in the range of 1-65535. Applications can freely choose them,
but controls won't support more than a fixed number of different requests.
Requests can be deleted, see the section on VIDIOC_REQUEST_CMD.

The expected usage is that request IDs are some base value + the buffer index.
Request lookup is optimized for that scheme inside the control framework: there
is a hash table of size VIDEO_MAX_FRAME, each element being a linked list.
The hash function used is 'request % VIDEO_MAX_FRAME', and then the linked list
is walked to find whether the request is in there. The expectation is that
having more than VIDEO_MAX_FRAME requests will be very unusual, and certainly
that the maximum number of possible requests in flight at the same time won't
be more than a small multiple of VIDEO_MAX_FRAME.

Associating a buffer with a specific request can be done by setting the new
'request' field in struct v4l2_buffer to the request ID.

Once a buffer is queued with a non-zero request ID, then it is up to the
driver to apply the control values for that request at the right time ensuring
that when the buffer is DMAed those values are in effect.

This is entirely hardware specific, so it is the driver's responsibility. It
will know the request ID of a buffer as soon as the vb2 buf_queue op is called.

For simple cases a helper function v4l2_ctrl_apply_request() is available that
will just apply any controls for the given request immediately. The driver can
call that when the buffer is about to be filled. This is likely to be too crude
for the more complex devices, in particular when dealing with settings that can
take some time before that will take effect (e.g. focussing).


Complex Devices
===============

For complex devices with lots of video and v4l-subdev device nodes you want to
be able to synchronize buffers and controls for multiple nodes and apply them
all as a single request.

The way to do that is to:

1) use the same request ID for all device nodes when setting controls for that
   request.
2) instead of using VIDIOC_QBUF use VIDIOC_PREPARE_BUF with the request field
   set everywhere you need to have a buffer associated with the request.
3) when all is done, call VIDIOC_REQUEST_CMD(V4L2_REQ_CMD_QUEUE) with the
   request ID on any video or v4l-subdev node.

The V4L2_REQ_CMD_QUEUE command will call a top-level 'req_queue' callback in
the driver, at which point it is the responsibility of the driver to pull
everything together and ensure that all prepared buffers are queued up at the
right time to the DMA queues and all controls for that request will be applied
at the right moment.

Two helper functions were created to aid with with: vb2_qbuf_request() will
queue up a prepared buffer with the given request ID. And v4l2_device_req_queue()
will walk all video_device structs and do just that for each of them. The last
function only works for simple devices, complex devices will almost certainly
need to create their own function.


Feedback
========

After a buffer is dequeued you can get the control values that were actually
used when filling in that buffer by calling VIDIOC_G_EXT_CTRLS with the request
field set to buffer->request. This can also be used to obtain additional meta
information by creating read-only controls that are filled in by the driver
for that specific buffer.

Currently there is no event that is triggered when someone sets a new control
value for a specific request. This can be added, but I suspect it will make
more sense to have driver-specific events (e.g. 'EVENT_METADATA_AVAILABLE')
that applications can use.

A new control flag was added: V4L2_CTRL_FLAG_REQ_APPLIED. If set, then the
control value for the request was applied.

Note: once the control value for a request has been applied it will never be
applied again. Only after it has been set again (using VIDIOC_S_EXT_CTRLS)
will the control value for that request be applied.

Using VIDIOC_REQUEST_CMD it is possible to keep applied values and reapply
them, but that is not the standard behavior and is experimental since it
is not clear whether this is actually needed (or even wanted).


VIDIOC_REQUEST_CMD
==================

#define V4L2_REQ_CMD_BEGIN      (0)
#define V4L2_REQ_CMD_END        (1)
#define V4L2_REQ_CMD_DELETE     (2)
#define V4L2_REQ_CMD_APPLY      (3)
#define V4L2_REQ_CMD_QUEUE      (4)

/* Flag for V4L2_REQ_CMD_BEGIN */
#define V4L2_REQ_CMD_BEGIN_FL_KEEP      (1 << 0)

struct v4l2_request_cmd {
        __u32 cmd;
        __u16 request;
        __u16 flags;
        union {
                struct {
                        __u32 data[8];
                } raw;
        };
};

The VIDIOC_REQUEST_CMD ioctl is used for a variety of request-related
purposes. These will be explained in more detail below.

V4L2_REQ_CMD_BEGIN/END
----------------------

While it is easy to use VIDIOC_S_EXT_CTRLS to set control values for a specific
request, you cannot do that with VIDIOC_S_CTRL since there is no request field
in the v4l2_control struct. And in fact it is desirable to be able to use other
ioctls with requests as well (e.g. VIDIOC_S_SELECTION).

In order to allow other ioctls to be used as part of a request you can use the
BEGIN/END commands to bracket a bunch of other ioctls, all of which (where
appropriate) will be stored as part of the request.

Currently this is only implemented for the control ioctls. But VIDIOC_S_SELECTION
is a prime candidate for the future. Internally however, the selection data
would have to be stored as a control since all request data are always controls.

Whether ioctls apply to a request is per-filehandle: calling VIDIOC_REQUEST_CMD
with V4L2_REQ_CMD_BEGIN will mark the filehandle that future ioctls need to be
applied to the specified request. V4L2_REQ_CMD_END will 'unmark' the filehandle
and everything will be back to normal.

Calling V4L2_REQ_CMD_BEGIN with the V4L2_REQ_CMD_BEGIN_FL_KEEP flag will prevent
request control values to be discarded after they are applied. Instead they will
be kept and re-applied the next time controls for that request need to be set.

V4L2_REQ_CMD_DELETE
-------------------

Delete all control values for the given request (if non-zero) or delete all
control request values for all requests (if zero).

This is recommended at the beginning of the application to discard any old
request control values from the driver.

V4L2_REQ_CMD_APPLY
------------------

Explicitly apply the control values for the given request. This takes effect
immediately.

V4L2_REQ_CMD_QUEUE
------------------

Queue all buffers for the given request for all device nodes. This may not be
supported by the driver. Test this by calling it with request 0: if ENOSYS is
returned, then this functionality is not supported.


Miscellaneous
=============

The vivid driver has support for all this: the brightness, contrast, saturation
and hue controls all support up to VIDEO_MAX_FRAME requests.

Git tree for these patches:

http://git.linuxtv.org/cgit.cgi/hverkuil/media_tree.git/log/?h=requests

Utilities with support for requests are available here:

http://git.linuxtv.org/cgit.cgi/hverkuil/v4l-utils.git/log/?h=requests

Remaining questions:

- Should we keep the V4L2_REQ_CMD_BEGIN_FL_KEEP flag?
- Do we need request-related events? And if so, which events are needed?
- Anything missing?

Known TODOs:

- DocBook patches: have to wait until this is ready to be merged, which will
  require an actual driver that wants to use it.
- Almost certainly: add support for VIDIOC_G/S_SELECTION and requests. An
  older version of this work exists, but it needs to be reworked quite a
  bit. Contact me if this is needed.
